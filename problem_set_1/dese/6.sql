-- DESE wants to assess which schools achieved a 100% graduation rate. In 6.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of schools (public or charter!) that reported a 100% graduation rate.

SELECT "name" FROM schools
WHERE "id" IN (
    SELECT "school_id"
    FROM graduation_rates
    WHERE "graduated" = '100'
);
